# About of Shopping-App (Why we use online shopping-App)

Online food ordering is the process of ordering food, for delivery or pickup, from a website or other application. The product can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen, restaurant, or a virtual restaurant) or food that has not been specially prepared for direct consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, fruits, frozen meats. etc).

Online food ordering/delivery through third-party companies have emerged as a global industry, leading to a "delivery revolution."
